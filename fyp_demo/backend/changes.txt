my backend has:

Uses ES Modules consistently (import/export)
-connect to local MongoDB correctly
-handles bcryptjs password hashing and comparison
-has a working router + controller + model flow (mvc structure)
-runs smoothly with npm run dev and nodemon

-added "type":"module" in package.json to folow es 

# NOW FROM ES Modules CHANGES USE:

Keep ES Modules consistent — don’t mix require/module.exports with import/export.
always include .js in local imports when using ES Modules.
Use named exports in models if you want to export helper functions (create, findOne) instead of the raw model.
.env should have your MONGO_URI and any other secrets; never commit it publicly.
Nodemon will auto-restart when you save files — keep an eye on logs for DB connection or route errors.
